[2024-10-27 13:06:04 UTC] No materializer is registered for type <class 'steps.model_training.ModelOutput'>, so the default Pickle materializer was used. Pickle is not production ready and should only be used for prototyping as the artifacts cannot be loaded when running with a different Python version. Please consider implementing a custom materializer for type <class 'steps.model_training.ModelOutput'> according to the instructions at https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/handle-data-artifacts/handle-custom-data-types
